# Patient-Flow-Management-Dashboard (Interactive Dashboard using MS Excel)
## Project Objective
The goal of this project is to design an interactive dashboard for monitoring patient flow data in a healthcare facility for the year 2024. The dashboard helps hospital management track patient admissions, wait times, satisfaction scores, department-wise referrals, and demographic insights — supporting better healthcare service planning and patient experience management.

## Dataset Used
<a href="https://github.com/Kkayande2004/-Patient-Flow-Management-Dashboard/blob/main/Hospital%20emergecy%20room%20data.xlsx">Dataset1</a>

## Key Questions (KPIs)
How many patients visited the facility?

What is the average patient wait time?

What is the patient satisfaction score?

What is the age-wise distribution of patients?

What is the percentage of patients admitted vs not admitted?

What is the gender-wise patient distribution?

What is the department-wise patient referral count?

What percentage of patient responses are on-time vs delayed?

## Process
Verified data for missing values and corrected inconsistencies.

Standardized data formats for dates, numbers, and categories.

Created pivot tables for each key metric and demographic analysis.

Developed interactive charts (bar charts, pie charts, KPI cards).

Merged all visuals into one consolidated dashboard.

Applied month and year slicers for dynamic filtering.

## Dashboard Overview
Key Metrics:

Total Patients: 519

Average Wait Time: 35.81 minutes

Patient Satisfaction Score: 5.15

Admitted Patients: 266 (51%)

Gender Distribution: Female 51%, Male 49%

On-time Patient Response: 62%

Top Age Group: 60-69 years

## Project Insights
The 60-69 age group has the highest patient count.

General Practice handles the majority of patient referrals.

51% of patients are admitted while 49% are not.

The gender split is balanced, with a slight edge to female patients (51%).

62% of patients are attended on-time, while 38% experience delays.

Average patient wait time is approximately 35 minutes.

## Final Conclusion
To enhance patient experience and operational efficiency:

Focus on reducing wait times for age groups with higher visits (60–69 years).

Increase staffing and resources in General Practice to manage referrals.

Improve admission processes to maintain balanced patient flow.

Monitor delay percentages closely and work towards improving the on-time response rate.
